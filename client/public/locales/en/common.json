      "Hello, I'm Carolina, a Software Engineering student focused on frontend development, currently specializing in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Iâ€™ve been dedicating myself to practical projects, always aiming to write strategic, clean, and innovative code. Before entering the tech field, I worked as a teacher and also handled administrative routines in the educational sector. This experience gave me a solid foundation in organization, communication, problem-solving, and continuous learningâ€”skills I now bring into the programming world. I'm currently transitioning my career into tech and looking for an internship opportunity in frontend development. I want to combine my background in education with the tech world, contributing with creative, efficient, and adaptable solutions.",
