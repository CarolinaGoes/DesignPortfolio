      "Hi, I'm Carolina, a Software Engineering student focused on frontend development, currently specializing in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I have dedicated myself to practical projects, always seeking to write code that is strategic, clean, and innovative. Before entering the technology field, I worked as a teacher and also with administrative routines in the educational sector. This experience provided me with a solid foundation in organization, communication, problem-solving, and continuous learning, skills that I carry with me into the world of programming. I am currently transitioning my career to the technology area and seeking a frontend development internship opportunity. I want to combine my experience in education with the world of technology, contributing with creative, efficient, and adaptable solutions.",
