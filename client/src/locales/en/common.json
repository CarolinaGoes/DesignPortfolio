  "about": [
    "Hi, I'm Carolina, a Software Engineering student focused on frontend development. I'm currently specializing in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I dedicate myself to practical projects, always aiming to write code strategically, cleanly, and innovatively. Before entering the tech field, I worked as a teacher and in administrative routines in the educational sector. That experience gave me a solid foundation in organization, communication, problem-solving, and continuous learningâ€”skills I carry into the programming world. I'm currently transitioning into tech and looking for an internship in frontend development. I want to merge my experience in education with tech, contributing with creative, efficient, and adaptable solutions.",
    "ðŸ“© I'm open to new opportunities, connections, and learning in the tech ecosystem!"
