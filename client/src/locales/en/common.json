  "about": [
    "Hi, I'm Carolina, a Software Engineering student focused on frontend development, currently specializing in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Iâ€™ve been dedicating myself to hands-on projects, always aiming to write code that is strategic, clean, and innovative. Before transitioning into tech, I worked as a teacher and in administrative roles within the education sector. That experience gave me a strong foundation in organization, communication, problem-solving, and continuous learningâ€”skills I now bring into the programming world. I am currently transitioning into the tech field and seeking a frontend development internship. I want to combine my background in education with technology, contributing with creative, efficient, and adaptable solutions.",
    "ðŸ“© I'm open to new opportunities, networking, and continuous learning in the tech ecosystem!"
