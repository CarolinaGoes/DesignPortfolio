      "Hi, I'm Carolina, a Software Engineering student focused on frontend development, currently specializing in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I have been dedicated to practical projects, always seeking to write code strategically, cleanly, and innovatively. Before entering the tech field, I worked as a teacher and also in administrative routines in the educational sector. This experience provided me with a solid foundation in organization, communication, problem-solving, and continuous learning — skills I bring to the programming world. I am currently transitioning my career into technology and looking for an internship opportunity in frontend development. I want to combine my experience in education with the tech world, contributing with creative, efficient, and adaptable solutions.",
